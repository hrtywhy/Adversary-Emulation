#### CALDERA
CALDERA offers an intelligent, automated adversary emulation system that can reduce resources needed by security teams for routine testing, freeing them to address other critical problems. It can be used to test endpoint security solutions and assess a networkâ€™s security posture against the common post-compromise adversarial techniques contained in the ATT&CK model. CALDERA leverages the ATT&CK model to identify and replicate adversary behaviors as if a real intrusion is occurring
